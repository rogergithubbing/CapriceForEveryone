# CapriceForEveryone
CapriceForEveryone - an Amstrad CPC emulator based on Caprice Forever

To be able to compile and run the emulator, you will have to use RAD Studio; You can obtain an evaluation copy of it at https://www.embarcadero.com/es/products/rad-studio/start-for-free.

Just open the CapriceForEveryone.groupproj file in RAD Studio, then right click on the Caprice.exe project and click "Activate", and then you can run the project.

There are lots of issues to fix from the time being (warnings, testing, source code relocation, third party libraries and other stuff that should not be included), but the most important thing right now, is that it compiles and runs.

Future plans include enhancements to sna saves to generate history backups, controller mappings and who knows what else.

Feel free to contact me at rogertranchez@gmail.com; Any helpful and collaborative comments will be appreciated.
